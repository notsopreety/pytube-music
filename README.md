- **High-Quality Audio**: Downloads the best available audio quality, with support for MP3 format.
- **Filename Sanitization**: Ensures safe, clean filenames by removing invalid characters and replacing spaces with underscores.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notsopreety/pytube-music.git
   cd pytube-music
   ```

   - **Linux**: Install via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install ffmpeg` for Ubuntu).

## Usage

Run the script using Python:
```bash
python run.py
```

The CLI displays an ASCII banner and a menu with the following options:
1. Download music by music URL
2. Download playlist (auto full)
3. Download playlist (manually choose)
4. Search and download
5. Exit

### Examples

- **Download a Single Track**:
  Select option 1, enter a YouTube video URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example`), and specify a save directory (or press Enter for the current directory).

- **Download a Playlist Automatically**:
  Select option 2, enter a playlist URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=example`), and the tool will create a folder named after the playlist and download all tracks.

- **Download a Playlist with Manual Approval**:
  Select option 3, enter a playlist URL, and approve or skip each track after reviewing its title and URL.

- **Search and Download**:
  Select option 4, enter a search query (e.g., `lofi hip hop`), choose a result from the top 5, and download the selected track.

### Notes
- Files are saved with the track title as the filename (e.g., `Song_Title.mp3`).
- The tool skips existing files to prevent overwrites.
- Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel operations or exit the program gracefully.
